# Curse of Dimensionality
Philipp Schmitt, 2020  
*Software artwork commissioned by MIT Center for Arts, Science & Technology.*

Generated collages of diagrams from research papers that mention terms related to high-dimensional space.

The expression “Curse of Dimensionality” refers to challenges of understanding high-dimensional, mathematical spaces beyond the three dimensions humans are accustomed to. Working in this space — of which all images can only be partial projections — requires of the scientist an intuition for the unimaginable.

## Diagrams
This repository comes pre-populated with a selection of diagrams scraped from open-access research papers mentioning terms related to *high-dimensional space*, *latent space*, and so forth. You can easily scrape a different set of images from [arXiv.org](https://arxiv.org) using the included scraper script.

The scraper is written in Python and documented in *Diagram Scraper.ipynb*, a Jupyter notebook. To open it, get [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org). Then start it using the Terminal command `jupyter notebook`. Jupyter will open in a browser window. 

Note that using the scraper will overwrite the included diagram selection.


## Captions
Each diagram collage is captioned using a random quote, drawn from a selection compiled by the artist in *quotes.js*. These quotes come from artificial intelligence research publications, philosophy, other literature, and the artist's own writing.
