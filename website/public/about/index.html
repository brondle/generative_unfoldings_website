They were commissioned by the <a target='_blank' href='https://arts.mit.edu/cast/'>MIT Center for Art, Science & Technology (CAST)</a> and co-presented by the MIT <a target='_blank' href='https://tropetank.com/'>Trope Tank</a> in conjunction with the 2021 CAST Symposium, <a target='_blank' href='https://unfoldingai.mit.edu/'>“Unfolding Intelligence.”</a></p><p>An open call for sketches and prototypes asked artists to respond to the following question: How can artist-programmers working in the field of computer-generated art make unique contributions to the current discussion of artificial intelligence (AI)?
