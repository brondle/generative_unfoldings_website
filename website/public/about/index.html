target='__blank' href='https://unfoldingai.mit.edu/panelist/nick-montfort/'>Nick Montfort</a>, the <i>Generative Unfoldings</i> exhibition is a collection of 14 generative software artworks commissioned by the <a target='__blank' href='https://arts.mit.edu/cast/'>MIT Center for Art, Science & Technology (CAST)</a> and co-presented by the MIT Trope Tank in conjunction with the 2021 CAST Symposium, <a target='__blank' href='https://unfoldingai.mit.edu/'>“Unfolding Intelligence”</a>.</p><p>An open call for sketches and prototypes asked artists to respond to the following question: How can artist-programmers working in the field of computer-generated art make unique contributions to the current discussion of artificial intelligence (AI)? A jury of practicing creative coders and critical technologists—namely, Montfort, <a target='__blank' href='https://www.sarahrosalena.com/'>Sarah Rosalena Balbuena-Brady</a>, <a target='__blank' href='https://unfoldingai.mit.edu/panelist/d-fox-harrell/'>D.

Mital</a>—reviewed the sketches and awarded the commissions. The artists here release their works both as the Generative Unfoldings (Screen) exhibition of in-browser artworks (permanently hosted on CAST’s servers) and as a <a target='__blank' href='https://brondle.github.io/generative_unfoldings/'>Generative Unfoldings (Code)</a> GitHub repository (where all the works’ codes are available to the public as free software).</p><h3>About the MIT Center for Art, Science & Technology (CAST)</h3><p><a target='__blank' href='https://arts.mit.edu/cast/'>CAST</a> creates new opportunities for art, science, and technology to thrive as interrelated, mutually informing modes of exploration, knowledge, and discovery.
