A jury of practicing creative coders and critical technologists—namely, Montfort, <a target='__blank' href='https://www.sarahrosalena.com/'>Sarah Rosalena Balbuena-Brady</a>, <a target='__blank' href='https://unfoldingai.mit.edu/panelist/d-fox-harrell/'>D.

Mital</a>—reviewed the sketches and awarded the commissions. The artists here release their works both as the Generative Unfoldings (Screen) exhibition of in-browser artworks (permanently hosted on CAST’s servers) and as a <a target='__blank' href='https://brondle.github.io/generative_unfoldings/'>Generative Unfoldings (Code)</a> GitHub repository (where all the works’ codes are available to the public as free software).</p><h3>About the MIT Center for Art, Science & Technology (CAST)</h3><p><a target='__blank' href='https://arts.mit.edu/cast/'>CAST</a> creates new opportunities for art, science, and technology to thrive as interrelated, mutually informing modes of exploration, knowledge, and discovery. CAST’s multidisciplinary platform presents performing and visual arts programs, supports research projects for artists working with science and engineering labs, and sponsors symposia, classes, workshops, design studios, lectures, and publications.</p><h3>About the Artists</h3>" }
